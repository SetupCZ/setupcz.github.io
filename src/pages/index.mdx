I'm a backend developer at JABLOTRON CLOUD Services, previously working as a full-stack developer and team lead at Qest Technologies.
During my time at Qest, I worked on the Heureka project where my team of four was integrated with Heureka's Road to product team,
managing eight projects including category-search, homepage and product compare, focusing on re-platforming,
performance optimization and enabling feature parity for every Heureka Group country.

## Extracurricular

### I try to write

#### Solids' SSR streams keeping me in suspense

https://medium.com/qest/solids-ssr-streams-keeping-me-in-suspense-e0a870d95280 <br />
The article explains how Suspense in SolidJS addresses asynchronous consistency issues in web development,
particularly through Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and streaming.

#### Load Testing with k6

https://medium.com/qest/load-testing-with-k6-ef17a1f64def <br />
The article covers k6, an open-source load testing tool, explaining how to run JavaScript tests via the command line,
set performance checks and thresholds, simulate various traffic patterns, and export performance data for analysis.

### I also spoke at a meetup

#### How to test a Dragon

https://youtu.be/TDS-xyDXI6s?si=_BiISKHlzR4Y58Ie <br />
The presentation explores how one of the largest e-commerce companies in the Czech Republic ensures code correctness
and functionality, covering the testing pyramid, various test types, their purposes, and the use of React Testing
Library, end-to-end testing principles, and the benefits of switching to Cypress for faster pipelines.

#### NestJS workshop for Direct fidoo developers

The workshop provided an introduction to the NestJS framework. It covered the basics of NestJS, including its
architecture, modules, controllers, services, and decorators. We learned how to build a simple REST API,
leverage dependency injection, and use middleware for request handling. We dug deeper into the framework's features,
such as guards, interceptors, and filters, and discussed testing strategies and best practices. We've finished with an
example of microservice communication through Redis.
